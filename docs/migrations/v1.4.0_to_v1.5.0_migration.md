# 🔁 Migrating from Entiqon v1.4.0 to v1.5.0

Version `v1.5.0` introduces a new modular structure that promotes key packages
from internal usage to public, extensible entry points under flat package names
like `driver/` and `builder/`.

This migration guide will help you transition your projects safely and take advantage
of the new extensibility features.

## 🔀 Package Moves

| Old Path                             | New Path                     |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `internal/core/driver`               | `driver`                     |
| `internal/core/builder`              | `builder`                    |
| `BaseDialect`                        | `driver.BaseDriver`          |
| `SelectBuilder`, `InsertBuilder`, etc.| `builder.*Builder`          |

## ✅ Update Your Imports

Before:

```go
import "github.com/entiqon/entiqon/internal/core/driver"
```

After:

```go
import "github.com/entiqon/entiqon/driver"
```

---

## 🧩 Extending with Custom Drivers

You can now embed `driver.BaseDriver` and expose your own dialect:

```go
type MyDialect struct {
	driver.BaseDriver
}
```

## 📚 Helpful References

- `driver/README.md`
- `builder/README.md`
- `docs/developer/driver/custom_driver_guide.md`

## 🛡️ Compatibility Notes

These changes are **breaking** for import paths. If you're upgrading from `v1.4.0`:

- You must refactor imports and embedded types
- Builders now reside in `builder/`
- Dialects are resolved via public constructors

If you are using Go modules:

```bash
go get github.com/entiqon/entiqon@v1.5.0
```
