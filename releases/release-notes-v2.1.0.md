# Entiqon v2.1.0 Release Notes

Release Date: 2025-08-03

---

## Added

- Introduced the **Common** package — a foundational shared utilities and reusable components module for Entiqon.  
- Created the **Sharicon** icon representing the Common package, featuring a robot with orange eyes, bow tie, and an interconnected folders chest emblem symbolizing shared resources and collaboration.  
- Updated documentation and README for the Common package with quick start guides and developer guides placeholders.

---

## Notes

- The Common package complements existing Entiqon modules like `datacon`, `corecon`, and `toolicon` by providing shared foundational utilities.  
- The new icon design aligns with Entiqon’s visual branding and category color scheme for clear identification.
